            In high school, I competed in computer science and math
            competitions, and was also a member of my school&apos;s Science
            Olympiad and FIRST Robotics Competition teams . While I no longer
            participate in competitions, I still enjoy solving problems and
            learning new things.

            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games (particularly TFT,
            where I hit Challenger in Set 13), watching anime (some favorites
            include Spy x Family, Blue Lock, FMAB), eating Asian snacks
            (anything I can find in HMart), and shopping for random things to
            decorate my room with (a lot of Totoro + Pokemon merch).
